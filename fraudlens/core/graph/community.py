"""Shared Louvain community detection for FraudLens's ring/cluster
detection.

Both GraphBuilder (ring membership within a subgraph, for GraphEvidence)
and GraphAgent (ring-size estimation for its confidence scaling) reduce
to the same underlying question: given accounts connected by shared
devices/IPs, which ones form a community? Rather than each rolling its
own connected-components walk, both call this one networkx-backed
implementation.

Real community detection (modularity maximization) over connected-
components is the point of this module, not just a rename: a plain
walk treats "connected" as binary, so one bridging account can pull two
otherwise-separate clusters into a single reported ring. Louvain weighs
*how* connected — two accounts sharing several devices/IPs pull harder
than two that share just one — so a weak single-shared-device bridge
between two dense clusters can resolve into two separate communities
instead of one over-counted ring.
